	<p>The Egyptians, Greeks and Romans used various crude ciphers as early as 1900 B.C. All of these ciphers were vulnerable to frequency analysis, but sufficed due to the rarity of the technique until the printing press.

	  A major improvement in the form of the polyalphabetic cipher, as well as the realization that the obscurity of a cipher was no guarentee of its security, sparked off an arms race of increasingly secure ciphers culminating in today's asymmetric ciphers and which is still ongoing.</p>
