	<p>Attacks are catorigorized into two types: passive attacks, where the attacker copies and breaks encrypted messages without altering them, and active attacks, where the attacker <i>does</i> attempt to alter the messages.

	<p>Most all cipher schemes are designed with these two assumptions in mind:</p>
	<p>1. that encoded messages <i>will</i> be intercepted and recorded, <i>without</i> the knowledge of the sender or the reciever--in other words, that the channel will be passively attacked. <br>2. that the sender and reciever have not been compromised, so only the ciphertext is avaliable to the attacker.</p>

	<p>Symmetrical ciphers can be attacked directly in a variaty of ways, depending on the exact nature of the cipher. Simple transposition or substitution ciphers can be broken trivially with pencil and paper, while more complex ciphers may be more difficult or need to be brute-forced. The Enigma cipher, for instance, resisted attack so effectively that Turing machines had to be invented to brute-force it.</p>
	
	<p>One time pads are impossible to attack so long as the message is shorter than the pad used to encrypt it, and each pad is never used more than once. To the attacker, <b>any</b> message of a given length is equally likely to be correct. If a longer message is sent, however, or if a pad is reused, the one time pad becomes no more secure than the cipher used to encode it.</p>
	
	<p>There are also, of course, the endless variaty of lead pipe analysis, phishing, and other attacks that acquire the plaintext or the key via a less secure channel--this invalidates the second assumption. Symmetrical ciphers and one-time pads are especially vulnerable to this, as they need secure channels to exchange keys and pads. Similiarly, asymmetric ciphers may be vulnerable to Man In Middle Attacks where the attacker inpersonates the two corrospondents to exchange keys with them instead of eachother.</p>
