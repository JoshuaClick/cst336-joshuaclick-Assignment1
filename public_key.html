	<p>An asymmetric cipher is a cipher where users encrypt messages with the public key of their reciepient, and decrypt incoming messages with their own private keys. These ciphers are based on mathematical operations that are easy to conduct but difficult to reverse.</p>

	<p>Like all modern ciphers, asymmetric ciphers are difficult to attack even if the attacker knows how the cipher works. Unlike symmetrical ciphers, however, public keys can be safely given out without compromising any message's security. This is what allows assymetric ciphers to be used widely--they don't need any prior arrangements to set up a secure channel.</p>
